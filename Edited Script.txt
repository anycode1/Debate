Edited Script

Should we allow the chains of our past to dictate the decisions that shape our future? Greetings to everyone present here—respected judges, teachers, and my esteemed opponents. Today, I stand resolutely in support of modern values.”  

“Traditional cultural values often come at the expense of individual freedom. Important life choices, such as whom to marry or which career to pursue, are frequently imposed by family and societal expectations rather than being based on the individual's own desires. Fortunately, this dynamic is shifting as modern values promote individualism and the right to self-determination.”  

“Moreover, cultural values have perpetuated harmful superstitions throughout history. Practices like Sati in India and the Salem witch trials exemplify how blind adherence to cultural norms can lead to devastating consequences. Women were burned alive, widows ostracized, and innocent people lost their lives—all justified by cultural tradition. Is this truly something we should continue to uphold?”  

“Additionally, when the preservation of culture is taken to an extreme, it results in stagnation. Instead of embracing global progress, people cling to divisions, which fuels conflicts over dominance, fanaticism, and the erosion of unity. In our increasingly interconnected world, modern values encourage a global perspective rather than tribalism.”  

“In conclusion, cultures can be likened to recipes. When I prepare a dish for the first time and it is enjoyed, I don’t merely preserve it—I refine and improve it with each attempt. Similarly, modern values do not seek to destroy culture; rather, they aim to enhance it by questioning, correcting, and allowing it to evolve.”  

“Thank you, and with that, I conclude my argument.”
