Rebuttals

- Identity is important, but it shouldn't divide people with practices like patriarchy or caste. mv allows us to selectively preserve culture, while rejecting bad practices

-cv create unity, but mv unite not only as a community but also as a species

-past wisdom is valuable, but irrelevant to present changes(AI, climate change). mv adjusts past wisdom with science and technology

-cv demand conformity rather than genuine respect(silencing women & lower castes). mv promotes mutual rights and respect

-morality in cv is biased(justifying child marriage or caste discrimination). mv provide universal ethics

-tourists don't give af about oppression and rituals, they want beauty, history, food and art. These can be preserved without harmful cultural practices.

-cv don't have environmental respect because of animal sacrifice. mv adds scientific environmentalism

-passing down values is ok, but not if it limits freedom and progress. we needs equality and open-mindedness not restrictions
